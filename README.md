# SnapSpot PWA

## 🚨 Safari Blob Storage Compatibility Fix (2025-12)

**SnapSpot now supports all versions of Safari, including iOS/iPadOS, by migrating all map and photo image data in IndexedDB from Blob format to Base64 strings.**

- **Why?** Older Safari browsers do not support storing Blob objects in IndexedDB, causing failures when saving or loading maps/photos.
- **How?**
  - All image data is now stored as Base64 strings in IndexedDB.
  - On first launch after update, any legacy Blob data is automatically migrated to Base64 (one-time migration).
  - A full-screen overlay blocks UI and shows "Updating maps, please stand by" during migration.
  - Import/export, gallery, and thumbnails are fully compatible with both formats.
  - Migration is robust and error-tolerant; errors are logged but do not block app startup.
- **Result:** SnapSpot works seamlessly on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and all Safari versions (desktop and mobile).

See [docs/SafariBlobFix.md](docs/SafariBlobFix.md) and [docs/SafariBlobFix_Tasks.md](docs/SafariBlobFix_Tasks.md) for technical details and implementation notes.

## Getting Started

### 🚀 Live Demo
Visit the deployed app: `https://nielsih.github.io/SnapSpot`

### 📱 Install as PWA
1. Visit the app URL on any device
2. Look for "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" option or just bookmark the url
3. The app works offline after installation

### 🛠️ Local Development
1. Clone this repository
2. Serve files using a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### 📋 Deployment
See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed GitHub Pages setup instructions.

### Testing Offline Functionality
1. Load the app while online
2. Go to Developer Tools → Application → Service Workers
3. Check "Offline" to simulate offline mode
4. Refresh the page - the app should still work

- ✅ Dedicated search modal for maps, markers, and photos.
- ✅ Unified search across map names, descriptions, and file names.
- ✅ Search by Image File (via selection) for map lookup.
- ✅ "Clear Search" functionality (X button) within the search input.
- ✅ Map thumbnail/image click in search results and settings list opens image viewer.

  -   **Portrait Orientation (Mobile/Tablets)**: Buttons are fixed at the bottom with icons and labels, prominently featuring an enlarged "Place Marker" button in the center.
  -   **Landscape Orientation (All Devices)**: Buttons are fixed on the right side with icons and labels for easy access.
- ✅ Unified and redesigned action buttons with consistent sizing and clear labels across orientations.
- ✅ Touch-optimized zoom controls: Explicit zoom buttons are automatically hidden on touch-first devices, relying on pinch-to-zoom gestures.

## SVG Support Implementation ✅

**Complete SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) support has been implemented, allowing users to upload and work with vector-based maps while maintaining infinite zoom quality.**

### Phase 1: Basic SVG Support ✅
- ✅ **SVG File Detection**: Automatic detection of SVG files by MIME type (`image/svg+xml`)
- ✅ **Dimension Parsing**: Extracts dimensions from SVG `width`/`height` attributes or `viewBox`
- ✅ **Compression Bypass**: SVG files skip raster compression to preserve vector quality
- ✅ **Vector Rendering**: SVG maps render with perfect sharpness at all zoom levels
- ✅ **Marker Placement**: Full marker functionality on SVG maps (placement, dragging, photos)
- ✅ **Export/Import**: SVG maps preserved in JSON exports and HTML reports
- ✅ **Thumbnail Generation**: SVG thumbnails properly generated for map lists

### Phase 2: SVG Rotation Support ✅
- ✅ **Full Rotation**: SVG maps now support 90-degree rotation increments
- ✅ **Vector Quality Preservation**: Rotation applied via canvas transforms maintains vector sharpness
- ✅ **Coordinate Accuracy**: Marker positions correctly maintained across all rotation angles
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Rotation controls always visible for all map types
- ✅ **Performance**: GPU-accelerated transforms for smooth rotation experience

### Technical Implementation
- **File Processing**: `fileManager.js` - Added `getSvgMetadata()` for SVG dimension extraction
- **Rendering Engine**: `mapRenderer.js` - Enhanced `renderImage()` with SVG-specific rotation logic
- **Image Processing**: `imageProcessor.js` - Fixed thumbnail generation for SVG files
- **UI Controls**: `app.js` - Rotation controls always available for all map types
- **Storage**: Full compatibility with existing Base64 storage system

### Benefits
- ✅ **Infinite Zoom Quality**: Vector graphics remain sharp at any magnification
- ✅ **Smaller File Sizes**: Technical drawings typically 50-90% smaller than raster equivalents
- ✅ **Perfect for CAD/Floor Plans**: Ideal for architectural plans, site maps, technical diagrams
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on all browsers and devices
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing raster maps continue working unchanged

See [docs/SVG-Support-Implementation.md](docs/SVG-Support-Implementation.md) for detailed technical documentation.
